# causality

This repository contains the code for the paper "Causal forcing between sea surface temperature and low-level vorticity in the oceanâ€“atmosphere coupled system" by Eviatar Bach, Safa Motesharrei, Alfredo Ruiz-Barradas, Amir BozorgMagham, and Eugenia Kalnay.

All the code was written by Eviatar Bach. Licensed under the GNU Public License v3.0.

The Granger causality analysis is done using the MVGC Matlab library, and plotting is done in Python.
