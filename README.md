# Code for "Local atmosphere–ocean predictability: dynamical origins, lead times, and seasonality"

This repository contains the code for the paper "Local atmosphere–ocean predictability: dynamical origins, lead times, and seasonality" by Eviatar Bach, Safa Motesharrei, Eugenia Kalnay, and Alfredo Ruiz-Barradas.

All the code was written by Eviatar Bach, except for the anomaly time-series code which was written by Alfredo Ruiz-Barradas. Licensed under the GNU Public License v3.0.

The Granger causality analysis is done using the MVGC Matlab library, and plotting is done in Python.
